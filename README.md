This is an exploit for the bug used in PWN2OWN2021 by the Synactiv team to get a privilege escalation in one th estorage management drivers(Spaceport.sys).
This bug causes causes an overflow in nonpaged pool memeory.
This is my first attempt to write an exploit for windows so, the success rate of exploit working is not much.
And also the variables have shitty names and I know it!

Credits go the synactiv team for their extensive research in modern exploitation of pool memory overflow in Windows.
